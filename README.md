# woowoopx-AMM-DoraHacks-Aptos-Ctrl-MOVE-Hackathon-

This AMM is designed to work with Aptos and Move. I am looking for developers to contribute so please contact me upon your interest! 

My thoughts and notes.

The first step for developing this is to set up my local computer which has aptos 7.7.0 already installed. 

For me to start programming woowoopx-AMM, my installations are: APTOS CLI, GIT, 
I am programming using a MacBook Pro Apple M2 Max 32G Memory and MacOS Sequoia 15.6.1 (24G90)
