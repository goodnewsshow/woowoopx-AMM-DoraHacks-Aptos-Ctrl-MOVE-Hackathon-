# wooWoopX-AMM-DoraHacks-Aptos-Ctrl-MOVE-Hackathon-

This AMM is designed to work with Aptos and Move. I am looking for developers to contribute so please contact me upon your interest! The project is on DoraHacks as https://dorahacks.io/buidl/32788. I am enrolled in the DoraHAcks Aptos Ctrl+MOVE Hackathon https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/aptos-ctrlmove-hackathon/buidl

My thoughts and notes:

1. The first step for developing this is to set up my local computer which has Aptos 7.7.0 already installed. 

2. For me to start programming wooWoopX-AMM, my installations are: Aptos CLI, GIT CLI, pyCharm.

3. I am programming using a MacBook Pro Apple M2 Max 32G Memory and MacOS Sequoia 15.6.1 (24G90).

4. On 09/23/2025 I set up pyCharm with the Aptos Move plugin and the wrote my first Move contract. I ran the contract and the transaction was over the testnet. It cost 1734 Octas! I really like the concept of modules in the Move language. I posted this accomplishment as a milestone on DoraHAcks and am still looking for startup partners and developers who are willing to help.
