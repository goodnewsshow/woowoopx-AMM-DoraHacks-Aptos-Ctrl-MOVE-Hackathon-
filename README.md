# woowoopx-AMM-DoraHacks-Aptos-Ctrl-MOVE-Hackathon-

This AMM is designed to work with Aptos and Move. I am looking for developers to contribute so please contact me upon your interest! The project is on DoraHacks as https://dorahacks.io/buidl/32788. I am enrolled in the DoraHAcks Aptos Ctrl+MOVE Hackathon https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/aptos-ctrlmove-hackathon/buidl

My thoughts and notes:

1. The first step for developing this is to set up my local computer which has aptos 7.7.0 already installed. 

2. For me to start programming woowoopx-AMM, my installations are: APTOS CLI, GIT, 

3. I am programming using a MacBook Pro Apple M2 Max 32G Memory and MacOS Sequoia 15.6.1 (24G90)
